Write a Python program that prints 'Hello, world!' to the terminal.

Let's run it:

$ python print # Hello, world! print "Hello, world!"

When you run it, you get:

Hello, world!

This is probably not a good idea as it will print out a bad message.

The program will run and it will print out a "Hello, world!" message.
